Contents of Package:
final.py - Contains the code for parsing the dataset and implementing the KNN classifiers before and after doing Fisher's Linear Discriminant
graphs.py - Contains the code that generates the graphs of the experiment based on the data returned from final.py
results.txt - A text file that contains a sample output from running final.py with the function calls(26)
Wynk.csv - The dataset we are using
readme.txt - A text file that I hope helps you with understanding the contents of this submission

Instructions:
final.py contains two functions
func(k): performs the actual code with the k value as the param
calls(n): calls the func(k) method multiple times up to n

You should start with just doing func(1), takes around 7 minutes
calls(n) can take a very long time based on the parameter you pass to it

ASSUMPTIONS: THE INPUT YOU PROVIDE TO THE METHODS ARE VALID!!!!!
I did not error handle the parameters
